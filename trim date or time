Lets assume that the data is in text format (because of the ET)

In B1:
=LEFT(TRIM(A1),LEN(TRIM(A1))-5)
to display:
3/31/2010  4:18:00 PM
this removes any extra spaces and the (ET)

In C1:
=TIMEVALUE(MID(B1,FIND(" ",B1)+1,256))
and format as time 13:30:55
to display:
16:18:00
The formula discards the date and converts to a true time.
